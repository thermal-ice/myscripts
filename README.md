## Carlos' Personal Scripts

This repository is for all my personal scripts which I think can help save me some time. 

### List of scripts:

1. `getLength.sh` . This script is used for getting the length of a word. It can get the length of a single word, or multiple words. I hate having to manually count the number of characters there are in a long word, so I usually used python's `len()` function. I found this to be cumbersome, especially when I forget to insert the quotation marks and have to retype the command. Thus this script was born.
